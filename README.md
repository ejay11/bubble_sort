<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>

Exercise from <a href ="https://www.theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a>
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

Example:
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
